                    <p>When the Well of Eternity collapsed during the War of the Ancients, Grand Magistrix Elisande erected a mighty shield to protect Suramar City. This barrier saved the city but isolated it from the rest of the world for 10,000 years.</p>

                    <p>To sustain themselves, the Suramar elves created the Nightwell from the Eye of Aman'Thul. Over millennia, their dependence on its arcane energy transformed them into the Nightborne, a new race forever changed by their isolation.</p>

                        <p>Suramar was the location of the Temple of Elune, the central place of worship for the night elves. The high priestess of Elune lived in the temple. The Boughs of Azshara, Izal-Shurah and Arauk-Nashal were also located here.</p>
